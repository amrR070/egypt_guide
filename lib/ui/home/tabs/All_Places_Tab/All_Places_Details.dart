Most were built as tombs for the pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[1][2][3] At least 138 identified pyramids have been discovered in Egypt.[4][5] Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush, now located in the modern country of Sudan.

The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are at Saqqara, west of Memphis. Step-pyramid-like structures, like Mastaba 3808 attributed to pharaoh Anedjib,[6] may the predate the Pyramid of Djoser built c. 2630â€“2610 BCE during the Third Dynasty.[7] This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.""",
